Tesla Stock Price Forecasting using LSTM Neural Networks
This project is a deep learning-based time series forecasting model developed to predict the future stock prices of Tesla (TSLA). Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks — a special kind of recurrent neural network well-suited for sequential data — we aim to capture the underlying patterns and trends from Tesla's historical stock data.
This project is intended to demonstrate practical knowledge of deep learning in financial forecasting.
  Objective
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that:
•	Learns temporal dependencies in Tesla's stock price history,
•	Forecasts future closing prices based on past trends,
•	Helps identify the feasibility and challenges of using LSTM for real-world stock prediction.
Unlike traditional models that rely on linear regression or ARIMA, this approach uses a deep learning framework that can potentially uncover non-linear and long-term dependencies.
 
Project Components
Here’s a breakdown of the files and notebooks in this repository:
•	archive (4).zip: Contains raw Tesla stock price historical data in CSV format.
•	DLM_LSTM.ipynb: The core model implementation — data preparation, feature scaling, LSTM design, training, and evaluation.
•	LSTM_REPORT.ipynb: A complete report notebook explaining the project flow in a clean, reader-friendly format.
•	tesla_predictions.csv: Output file storing the model's predictions for visualization and further analysis.
 
Dataset Overview
The dataset contains several years of Tesla Inc. (TSLA) stock trading data, sourced likely from Yahoo Finance or a similar platform. It includes the following attributes:
•	Date: Trading date
•	Open: Opening price of the day
•	High: Highest price of the day
•	Low: Lowest price of the day
•	Close: Closing price of the day (used as target variable)
•	Volume: Number of shares traded
We use the Close price for forecasting, assuming it's the most representative of the stock's value at a given time.
 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before modeling, extensive EDA was performed to:
•	Identify trends, volatility, and price movements over time,
•	Check for missing values or outliers,
•	Normalize the data for stable LSTM learning.
Visual tools like line plots and moving averages were used to explore patterns, volatility, and correlations.
 
Model Architecture
The LSTM model used here consists of:
•	Input Layer: Historical Close prices in sequences (windowed time steps).
•	Two LSTM Layers: With dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
•	Dense Layer: Outputs a single prediction (next closing price).
•	Activation: ReLU for intermediate layers, linear for the final output.
We trained the model on 80% of the dataset and validated it on the remaining 20%.
LSTM is particularly useful here as it can remember long-term dependencies, unlike standard RNNs.
 
Model Performance & Visualization
The performance was measured using:
•	Mean Squared Error (MSE)
•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Key visualizations:
•	Predicted vs Actual prices
•	Loss curves across epochs
•	Zoomed-in views of key trends (e.g., post-COVID surge)
The model shows promising results with a clear overlap between the actual and predicted curves in validation.

Absolutely! Here's a clean, professional list of 6 fully expanded future enhancements for your LSTM-based Tesla stock prediction project — suitable for adding directly to your GitHub README.md or as part of a project roadmap:
 
Future Enhancements
1. Multivariate Time Series Modeling
Currently, the model uses only historical closing prices. In the future, additional features like trading volume, technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD), or macroeconomic data (like interest rates, inflation) can be included. These external inputs could provide richer context, improving the model’s predictive power and generalization.
2. Sentiment Analysis Integration
News headlines and social media sentiment heavily influence Tesla's stock price. Using NLP tools like VADER or BERT, real-time or historical news data can be analyzed and scored for sentiment. These scores can then be used as features in the LSTM, allowing the model to consider market psychology in its predictions.
3. Multi-step Forecasting
The current model predicts the stock price for the next day. Expanding it to forecast multiple days (e.g., 3-day, 5-day, or weekly price trends) will make it more practical for investors and analysts. This requires adapting the model architecture to predict sequences and handling error propagation through time.
4. Model Benchmarking with GRU, BiLSTM, and Transformers
To test the robustness of the LSTM model, alternative architectures like GRU (simpler RNN), Bidirectional LSTM (for better context understanding), and Transformer models (state-of-the-art for sequences) can be implemented and compared. This will help identify the most efficient and accurate model for this use case.
5. Model Deployment via Streamlit or Flask
Deploying the trained model as an interactive web application would make it accessible to non-technical users. Using tools like Streamlit or Flask, users could select time ranges, view prediction graphs, and download results. This would greatly enhance the usability and impact of the project.
6. Explainable AI (XAI) using SHAP or LIME
Integrating interpretability tools like SHAP would provide insights into which features or time points most influence the model’s predictions. This transparency is crucial for building trust in the model, especially for financial forecasting where decisions carry high stakes.
