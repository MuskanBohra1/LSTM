        " **PROJECT OVERVIEW**\n",
        "\n",
        "The stock market is inherently volatile and complex, influenced by numerous unpredictable factors. However, time series forecasting techniques, particularly using Deep Learning methods like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have shown potential in learning patterns from historical data to make informed predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project leverages Tesla Inc. (TSLA) historical stock data to develop a predictive model for forecasting stock prices using an LSTM architecture. The model is implemented using Python and deep learning frameworks such as Keras and TensorFlow.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement**\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional statistical methods like ARIMA and exponential smoothing fall short when capturing non-linear patterns and long-term dependencies in financial time series data. LSTM networks, which are designed to retain information over long sequences, are more suitable for modeling such data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goal:\n",
        "To develop an LSTM-based model that can forecast future stock prices using past stock data, with a focus on Tesla's (TSLA) closing price trends.\n",
